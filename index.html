        Take this trowel as a prepostion:
        <br>
        that you may take
        <br>
        to grow amongst
        <br>
        this time and place.
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        Within this soil below 
        <br>
        lies a cosmos, a forever-tangle
        <br> 
        of worlds, of which you are always
        <br>
        already holding the handle:
      </p>
      
      <p>Take this hold, and take this soil.
        <br>
        Take it and blot pictures
        <br>
        by which we may imagine the ask
        <br> 
        this Earth makes of us.
